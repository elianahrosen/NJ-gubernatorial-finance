      <p>National eyes were on New Jersey’s 2025 gubernatorial race. The election, between Republican former state representative Jack Ciattarelli and Democratic Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill, became one of the <a href = "https://whyy.org/articles/new-jersey-governor-race-highest-spending-general-election-2025/" target = "blank" > most expensive races </a> in the state’s history. By Sept. 16, both candidates had raised more than $11 million in the general election from individual donors and PACs, according to <a href = "https://www.elec.nj.gov/publicinformation/gub_public_funds_submit2025.htm" target= "blank" > data </a> from the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission. This comes after Sherrill and Ciattarelli each raised just over $9 million <a href = "https://www.njelecefilesearch.com/Searchcandidatemetrics" target = "blank" > during the primary season. </a> </p>

      <p>On Nov. 4, Sherrill won 57% of the vote, becoming the next governor-elect of the Garden State. </p>

      <p> Support for these candidates is bigger than just the state where they reside. As an off-year election, one year before the midterms and three years from the next presidential election, New Jersey’s governor’s race often gets a wider spotlight since it’s one of only a few state-wide races, said Ian Vandewalker, senior counsel and manager of elections and government at the Brennan Center for Justice. </p>

      <p> Money poured in from all around the country. New York City and Philadelphia were Ciattarelli’s biggest donor locations, while New York City and Washington, D.C. were big donating hubs for Sherrill, ELEC data shows. Vandewalker said this pattern reflects a greater partisan national atmosphere.</p>

      <p> “Partisans who can afford it all over the country, and certainly in New Jersey, are spending money to help their side,” said Vandewalker. “People are motivated again to see that their party is in control of as many states as they can help.” </p>

        <p> Sherrill raised over $1 million more from out-of-state donations than Ciattarelli, according to ELEC data. Ciattarelli raised only $900 thousand from contributors outside of New Jersey, compared to about $2.2 million from Sherrill as of Sept. 16. Mark Brockway, Syracuse University political science assistant professor, said this discrepancy is a reaction to the actions of the Trump administration.</p>

        <p>On issues like abortion access, ICE enforcement, gun laws and many others, decisions have recently become much more state-dependent. In this climate, a governor’s role is crucial, said Brockway. </p>

        <p>“States have become nodes of either resistance to the Trump administration or enabling of the Trump administration,” said Brockway. “States are now hyper important, arguably even more so than congressional races, because states are exercising more power than ever.”</p>

        <p> Katie Housel, an intern with Sherrill’s campaign, said Democrats from around the country wanted to “keep New Jersey blue,” and help push back against Donald Trump’s influence. </p>

        <p>In areas without local competitive races, donors often look elsewhere to donate, Vandewalker said. For example, according to ELEC data, San Francisco contributed nearly $90,000 to Sherrill’s campaign. This is likely because voters in San Francisco, a consistently blue area, didn’t worry about their home races. They may have felt less pressure to send money to a San Francisco Democrat they already thought would win, giving them more funds to send to Sherrill, Vandewalker said.  </p>

        <p> Still, over 80% of donations from both candidates came from New Jersey. Northern towns like Montclair, Morristown and Princeton were  among the highest contributors for Sherrill, while Cape May, Rumson and Warren raised the most for Ciattarelli. Sherril’s hometown of Montclair raised nearly $300,000 for her campaign from individual donors.  <BR> </BR>

        Campaign contributions are not necessarily indicators of the election outcomes, said Vandewalker. In the Democratic primary for New Jersey governor, a teachers union put <a href = "https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/06/02/teachers-union-pac-has-given-40m-to-group-backing-union-presidents-gubernatorial-run/" target = "blank" > $40 million behind Sean Spiller, </a> only for him to come in fifth place. In the end, no amount of money can literally buy someone’s vote, said Brockway. <BR> </BR>

        “There is a huge amount of work that individual people, without any money at all, can do to sway elections and make candidates represent their interests,” said Brockway.</p>

      </div>

        <p> New Jersey has a public financing program, where candidates can get public funding to match their campaign donations in exchange for agreements to cap spending. This explains the quasi-tie between the candidates at about $12 million in donations by Sept. 16, Vandewalker said. Their spending is capped, effectively limiting their needed donations. </p>

        <p> The election can often become an “arms race” between candidates, Vandewalker said. When one side is raising and spending more, the other side feels pressure to keep up and not be outspent. </p>

        <p> These donations come from both individual donors and big organizations, like political action committees. These PACs influence elections through direct donations and political advertisements. While many see Republicans as taking more money from corporate donors, that is not universally true, said Brockway. In fact, as of Sept. 16, both Sherrill and Ciattarelli had received nearly the same amount of donations from organizations, at about $7.5 million, nearly double the contributions from individual donors. </p>

        <p> Housel worked in Sherrill’s field office during the primary. She said most of her work was focused on get-out-the-vote efforts. Still, donations “play a key role” in those ventures, financing advertisements and marketing the election, she said. Campaigns are expensive endeavors, with expenditures like staff salaries, transportation, venue fees and most expensively, television advertisements. </p>

        <p> “It really is a financial thing,” Housel said. “Whoever has the most money is really set up to do better.” </p>
